        <div class="incard">
          <p> We love French fries, but for an American food variation on the potato theme, one beloved at Sonic drive-ins and school cafeterias everywhere, consider the Tater Tot. These commercial hash brown cylinders are indeed proprietary to the Ore-Ida company. If you'd been one of the Grigg brothers who founded Ore-Ida, you'd have wanted to come up with something to do with leftover slivers of cut-up potatoes, too. They added some flour and seasoning and shaped the mash into tiny tots and ut them on the market in 1956. A little more than 50 years later, America is eating about 32 million kilos of these taters annually. </p>

          <p> Cornbread is any quick bread containing cornmeal.  Cornbread is a great recipe to track through the past few centuries because it was so prolific a crop in America that it was consumed across class, race, and regional lines. Corn lends itself to change very easily and therefore variations of cornbread recipes through time, in regards to types of ingredients and technological advances, have enabled it to keep its important place in American cuisine.
The most basic cornbread recipe was made using cornmeal, water, cooking fat, and possibly salt. </p>
