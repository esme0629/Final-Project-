          We decided to start this project in efforts of informing people about food and culture of different regions around the world and encouraging them to try those new things!

    Jambo! I'm Abby Ngowe and both of my parents are Kenyan immigrants. Although I cannot speak the language (Swahili), I grew up with heavy influence of Kenyan culture and have visited the country three times. My family has incorporated a multitude of different dishes into our household, but my favorite would be Mandazi. Mandazi is basically fried dough that can be enjoyed as breakfast with Chai (black tea), or even dessert. My second favorite meal would be Nyama Choma which is a type of grilled meat that is the best I have ever had. There are no Kenyan restaurants that I know of, but I would strongly encourage people to try the cuisine!

I am a 17 year old rising senior. I was born and raised in Astoria N.Y. My parents are from Mexico making me a Latina coder. I visit Mexico every 2 years. I know how to read, write, and speak Spanish and I love my culture. I also love learning about different cultures. Last summer I studied abroad in China and had a lot of fun learning Chinese and trying new foods. My favorite mexican food is tacos dorados.

    I am a 16 year old girl that is born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. I like to dance, read, listen to music, watch shows, and watch movies. I joined the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program to try something new even though I’m not going to pursue a career in coding. But I’m glad I joined because I got to meet new people and learn new things. I am Haitian and my favorite dish is Fritaille.

    I am 16 years old and I am a proud Dominican! I was born in New York City but I was raised in a very Dominican household. Food is a big part of the Dominican culture, it's also my favorite aspect of the culture. Although there are various, amazing dishes from the Dominican Republic, my favorite would have to be the signature breakfast. Traditional Dominican breakfast consits of a fried egg, fried cheese and salami, and mangu. Mangu is basically mashed plantians.   Another one of my favorites is a very popular drink called the Morir Sonando. It's a combination of sweetened condensed milk and orange juice, it is one of my favorites. I think everyone should take a chance and taste the Dominican culture!

    I am a Puerto Rican 17 year old that's adventurous and curious about everything. Although I'm not your average Puerto Rican straight from the campo I know a lot about the culture. My favorite Puerto Rican food is definitely my grandma's famous alcapurrias. Nothing beats a summer night playing dominos in my backyard with my friends and family
